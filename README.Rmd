# climateStability

The goal of climateStability is to provide a simple set of `R`-based tools to generate climate stability estimates based on time slices of climate data.

## Installation

You can install climateStability from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hannahlowens/climateStability")
```

or from CRAN with:

```{r CRAN installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("climateStability")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to calculate climate stability using time-slice datasets for two variables:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# First, calculate deviation through time using even time slices
precipDeviation <- deviationThroughTime(variableDirectory = "../ClimateStabilityManuscript/precipfiles/",
                                        timeSlicePeriod = 1000, fileExtension = "asc")
temperatureDeviation <- deviationThroughTime(variableDirectory = "../ClimateStabilityManuscript/tempfiles/",
                                             timeSlicePeriod = 1000, fileExtension = "asc")

# Next, calculate stability for each variable (the inverse of deviation, scaled to between 0 and 1)
precipInvDev <- stabilityCalc(precipDeviation)
tempInvDev <- stabilityCalc(temperatureDeviation)

# Finally, multiply them together and rescale to estimate relative climate stability
climateStability <- rescale0to1(precipStability * tempStability)
```

For more information, refer to the vignette.
```{r vignette, eval = F}
browseVignettes("climateStability")
```
