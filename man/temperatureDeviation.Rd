\description{
Using *PaleoView* version 1.1 (Fordham, *et al.* 2017), 20 100-year climatological
means of mean annual temperature were generated over 1,000-year time slices from
the TRaCE21ka experiments implemented using the CCSM 3.0 climate model. We then
calculated deviation through time as the mean of standard deviations between time
slices divided by the time elapsed between time slices. This calculation was
performed using the `deviationThroughTime()` function in the `climateStability`
package.
