#' Worldwide deviation in mean annual temperature over the last 21,000 years
#'
#' Using *PaleoView* version 1.1 (Fordham, *et al.* 2017), 20 100-year climatological
#' means of mean annual temperature were generated over 1,000-year time slices from
#' the TRaCE21ka experiments implemented using the CCSM 3.0 climate model. We then
#' calculated deviation through time as the mean of standard deviations between time
#' slices divided by the time elapsed between time slices. This calculation was
#' performed using the `deviationThroughTime()` function in the `climateStability`
#' package.
