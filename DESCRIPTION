Title: Estimating Climate Stability from Climate Model Data
Version: 0.1.3
Authors@R: person("Hannah", "Owens", email = "hannah.owens@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Climate stability measures are not formalized in the literature and
  tools for generating stability metrics from existing data are nascent.
  This package provides tools for calculating climate stability from raster data
  encapsulating climate change as a series of time slices. The methods follow
